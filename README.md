## ABSTRACT 

Air quality has a significant impact on human health and activities.  Data is being collected
globally to understand the impacts on humans, but there are open platforms where
data is available.  In this report, we look at the landscape of open data platforms
and their use.  First, we explore the EPA AirNow data portal.  We then explore
the OpenAQ portal, and finally Air Quality Open Data Plaform.  We look at the similarities 
and differences of each platform which leads to the development of an evaluation
framework that includes FAIR data principles.
