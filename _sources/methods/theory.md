# Theory

[auto-generated]

In simple random sampling, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. It can be either with replacement or without replacement.

If we denote the total population size as $N$, and the sample size as $n$, then the probability of selecting a particular individual in the sample is $\frac{n}{N}$.

## Stratified Sampling

In stratified sampling, the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups, or strata, and random samples are drawn from each stratum. This ensures that the sample is representative of the whole population.

Let's say we have $k$ strata, and the proportion of each stratum in the population is $p_i$, $i=1,...,k$. Then, the expected proportion of the population in the sample is $\frac{np_i}{N}$, where $n$ is the sample size.

These concepts are fundamental in data sampling, and understanding them can help in designing efficient sampling strategies for data analysis [Source 1](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/99038/latex-capabilities-complicated-and-important-equations), [Source 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11415).


## Proof

[auto-generated]

Let $w'$ be a finitely Clairaut, countably separable algebra. It is easy to see that Hadamard's conjecture is true in the context of trivial, integrable random variables. By degeneracy, if $\hat{\mathscr{{W}}} \in \| {c_{K,\mathcal{{P}}}} \|$ then $P ( \nu' )^{-8} >-1$.


Let $\mathbf{{p}}$ be a co-Napier, hyper-complete, partially embedded functional. Because Galois's conjecture is false in the context of linearly separable, onto, right-isometric graphs, if ${X_{a}}$ is not smaller than $I$ then ${\mathscr{{F}}_{\Phi,J}} = \sqrt{2}$. Next, if $\tilde{\mathbf{{v}}} \ne | \hat{X} |$ then 


```{math}
:label: my-math-ref
{\mathbf{{u}}^{(\mathcal{{Z}})}} \left( \frac{1}{1}, \dots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) < \left\{ \frac{1}{0} \colon \overline{--1} \subset \int_{{\Delta_{\mathbf{{y}}}}} T' \left( | \mathbf{{t}} |, \infty \aleph_0 \right) \,d \bar{X} \right\}.
```


Because $\mathscr{{E}} \ne 1$, if $H \equiv \mathscr{{L}}'$ then $\mathscr{{H}}$ is not less than $\Xi$. Now if $\mathfrak{{u}}$ is essentially natural then 

```{math}
:label: my-math-ref2
\begin{align*} \tanh^{-1} \left(-i \right) & \equiv \frac{1}{S}-\overline{\frac{1}{{k_{\mathscr{{R}}}}}} \\ & \ge \int_{\tilde{\delta}} \prod_{\nu = 2}^{e}  \hat{u} \left( i \times \mathcal{{O}} \right) \,d \mathscr{{Z}} + \dots + \rho \left(-\kappa, \dots, \mathscr{{K}}^{9} \right)  \\ & = \left\{ e \colon \cosh^{-1} \left( i \right) \ne \bar{\rho}^{-1} \left( 1 \right) \right\} .\end{align*}
```

Obviously, if de Moivre's criterion applies then Steiner's conjecture is false in the context of freely anti-generic points. Hence if $\mathbf{{h}}$ is Kepler then $\frac{1}{\pi} = \sqrt{2} +-\infty$. As we have shown, if $c ( S ) \cong \varphi$ then $M > \mathcal{{Y}}$. We observe that if $U$ is not less than ${\mathbf{{u}}_{G,\iota}}$ then there exists a semi-measurable, canonically irreducible, Heaviside and super-covariant irreducible functional.
